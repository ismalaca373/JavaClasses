package com.class30_Interface;

public class Abstract_Vs_Interface {

//	We can implement multiple Iterfaces but we can extend only 1 class
//	To create a relationship to the Interface we use implements keyword while for classes we use extends
//	Inteface does not have a constructor while abstract class ha
//	Inteface does not have instance variables by default every variables is STATIC FINAL and it MUST BE  INITIALIZE while in Abstract class we can have both static and instance variables and we do need to initialize them
//	Inside Interface abstract method can be only public while in Abstract Class can be any access modifier except private.
//	In Inteface we have only abstract method, but since JAva 8 we can have default and static implemented methods, while no restriction in abstract class (defined and undifined)
//
//	Interface & Abstract class similarities
//
//	Both help to achieve abstraction
//	Both can have implemented and unimplemented methods
//	Both must participate in Inheritance
//	for Both you cannot create an Object


	
//	
//	4 Main OOPs concepts:
//		Inheritance - process of subclass accessing all properties and behavior of a super class
//			Single, Multilevel, Hieracial, Multiple (available only with concept of Interfaces), Hybrid (combination of 2 more)
//		Polymorphism - process when object can take many form/behaviour
//			Static Polymorphism/ Early Binding / Compile Time --> achieved throug method overloading
//			Dynamic Polymorphism/ Late Binding/ Run Time --> achieved throug method overrdding
//
//		Abstraction  -process of hiding implementation details
//			Achieved trough Abstract Classes and Intefaces
