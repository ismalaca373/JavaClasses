public interface Drivable {  // class yerine interface yaziyoruz.
	
//	interface is collection of public static final variables and public abstract methods
//	similar to class but bigger concept
//	All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
//  we can't create object of interface in main method
//  you can have multiple parents. you can achive multipla inheritance.
//	interface cannot be extended by a classs, implement edilir.
//  inheritance baglanti olmali.
//  methods are implicityl public also
//  iki inheritance birbirine baglamaya calisirsan extends kullanmalisin.
//  each interface has different behaviors, just like classes have different behaviors in them as well thatâ€™s why you extends from class to class 
//  An interface is a collection of methods that have no implementation 
//	- they are just created, but have no functionality. 
//	An interface is a bit like a class, except you can only declare methods and variables in the interface. 
//	You cannot actually implement the methods.
//	All the data members of interface are implicitly public static final.
//	Interface can not contain instance fields. Interface only contains public static final variables.
//	The java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method and public, static and 
//	final keywords before data members.
// can not be extende by a class, it is implemented by a class
//	A class can implement more than one interface at a time.A class can extend only one class, 
//	but implement many interfaces.
//	An interface can extend another interface, similarly to the way that a class can extend another class.
	
//	Interface doesn't contain Constructors
//  An interface cannot have access modifiers by default everything is assumed as public
//  Interface has only final static variables.
